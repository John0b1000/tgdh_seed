# Tree-based Group Diffie-Hellman for SEED Emulator
This repo contains a Python implementation of TGDH encryption scheme for use on the SEED Internet Emulator ([GitHub](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-emulator){:target="_blank"}). This implementation uses the Python library anytree ([docs](https://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html){:target="_blank"}). In order to generate tree visuals, Graphviz ([docs](https://graphviz.org/){:target="_blank"}) must be installed.
```
pip install anytree
```
```
brew install graphviz
```
## Usage: tree_demo.sh
```
./tree_demo.sh
```
*Ensure execution permission is given:*

```
chmod a+x tree_demo.sh
```
